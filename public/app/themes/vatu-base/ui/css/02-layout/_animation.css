 *
 * 1. Instant: Almost instant durations(<100ms) for fades and color animations.
 * 2. Shorter durations: (100ms â€“ 300ms) for simpler effects and relatively
 *    small-sized animations. Also use those for user initiated action that
 *    need feedback (touch, click, swipe, etc.)
 * 3. Longer durations (> 300ms) for more complex effects and larger scale
      animations (such as page transitions or moving objects on and offscreen)
 * 4. Slow animations (> 500ms) for large movements and background elements
 *    that bring mood
