## Dependencies

### Development

These tools are needed to develop the site locally.

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [PHP](https://php.net/)
- [MySQL](https://mysql.com/)
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Most of this can be acquired using [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
Use you preferred method for developing locally.

## Documentation

During the Alpha/Beta stages, due to constant changes, documentation will be mainly written in-line. With a dedicated section being created at the first major release.

## Folder Structure

```

- `/public` files that need to be accessed by the public.
- `/public/app/` contains WordPress dependencies.
- `/tests/` All configs related to testing the project.
- `/tools/` Development tools not specific to the project.
- `/vendor` Dependencies install location.
- `composer.json` loads the PHP dependencies for this project.
- `example.env` sampled file with our environment variables are set.

## Setup

- Set the http authentication for composer eg `composer config -g http-basic.composer.deliciousbrains.com <username> <password>`.
- Install composers dependencies `composer install`.
- Update environment variables in the `.env` file. Wrap values that may contain non-alphanumeric characters with quotes, or they may be incorrectly parsed. * Database variables
  - `DB_NAME` - Database name
  - `DB_USER` - Database user
  - `DB_PASSWORD `- Database password
  - `DB_HOST` - Database host
  - Optionally, you can define `DATABASE_URL` for using a DSN instead of using the variables above (e.g. `mysql://user:password@127.0.0.1:3306/db_name`)
  - `WP_ENV `- Set to environment (`development`, `staging`, `production`)
  - `WP_HOME` - Full URL to WordPress home (https://example.com)
  - `WP_SITEURL` - Full URL to WordPress including subdirectory (https://example.com/wp)
  - `AUTH_KEY`, `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`, `LOGGED_IN_KEY`, `NONCE_KEY`, `AUTH_SALT`, `SECURE_AUTH_SALT`, `LOGGED_IN_SALT`, `NONCE_SALT`
  - Generate with [wp-cli-dotenv-command] (https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-dotenv-command)
  - Generate with [our WordPress salts generator](https://roots.io/salts.html)

## Theme

Watch theme files for changes and compile:

```sh
npm run build:watch
```

Build files for deployment:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Testing

We automatically run our code against the following tests at the commit, pull request, and build stages.

- `composer run test:lint`: Check our code is able to run without fatal errors
- `composer run test:security`: 3rd Party Dependencies we rely on do not contain known vulnerabilities
- `composer run test:unit`: Unit tests written during the development of our code
- `composer run test:analysis`: Check our code is writen to the highest standards we can

## Deploying

### Git Based Deployment.

Deployable branches should be appended with `-built` (eg. `main-built`). For development environments this could be`develop-built`.

You should never push code to built branches. All code should be pushed to the corrisponding branch. Where the built branch will pull from.

## Contributing

To contribute to this project:

- Create a branch off `main` eg, `feature/feature-name`, `hotfix/broken-part`, or `{issue-number}-{name-of-feature}`
- Push code to this branch once is becomes usable. Checking against our Coding Standards `composer run test`. Pushing often giving other chance to review and run QA tests against your new code. Rebasing from `main` will let you check you code works against production code
- When finished or requiring feedback, test your code on staging, pushing it to a branch prefixed with `staging/` to deploy to this projects staging server
- Any fixes should be applied to the origin branch and merged into your staging branch
- Once ready to be signed-off, create a pull request from your original branch in to `main`, assign a review and message the appropriate developer or channel. Detailing any changes that need to be made to the database/CMS
- With sign-off and passings tests, rebase and merge your branch into `main`

## Reporting Issues
